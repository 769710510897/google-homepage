# google-homepage

An attempt at copying Google's search page.
Can be seen here https://769710510897.github.io/google-homepage/

I did my best to avoid inspecting the original page and only copying by eye, although curiosity got the better of me so I did have a few looks.

As of right now only tested in Chrome on a 13" laptop.

### What I learned:
Up untill now I've mainly used the developer tools to check for javascript errors or for testing by printing things out to the console log. I've also inspected pages in order to get the markup for optimal crawling.

For this project I used it to edit the CSS directly in the developer tools, so I could see immediately how the elements were affected, and it made the process much smoother.
